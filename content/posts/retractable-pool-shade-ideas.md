How to Use Ideas to Best Effect: What do you need to do in order to create ideas?
If you're looking to create ideas, the first step is to come up with some good ones. There are a number of different ways to go about it, but the most important thing is to be specific and locked down on what you want your ideas to accomplish. After all, if you don't have a clear plan for how you're going to achieve your goals, it's hard to get anywhere. Here are some tips on how to use ideas effectively: 1) Start by brainstorming them. This will helpyou come up with a broad idea of what could work as an idea, but also help you focus on specific possibilities.2) Take everything you've brainstormed and put it into a written list or plan. This will giveyou some idea of where your ideas might fit and what steps need to be taken in order for them to become a reality.

The Future of Education: What will be the future of education?
The future of education is a question that has been asked for centuries and will continue to be asked in the coming years. Many different ideas have been proposed as to what the future of education should be, but no one single answer has emerged as the definitive answer. Some possible answers include: 
"Equality of opportunity" 
"Universal Basic Education" 
"Teacher training programs for all skill levels" 
" computer-assisted learning "
In terms of ideas, the most likely answer would be a form of universal basic education. This would provide all citizens with equal access to education, regardless of their economic status or educational qualifications. Another idea that has been proposed is teacher training programs for all skill levels. This would allow people of all skill levels to learn how to teach, which would then help reduce teaching costs and improve overall school quality.
