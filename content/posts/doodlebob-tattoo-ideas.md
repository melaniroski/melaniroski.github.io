The Industrial Revolution and Inventions
The Industrial Revolution and Inventions
Invention is often thought of as a lightbulb moment, or a eureka! experience. But invention is also the result of years of incremental improvements by many people. This was certainly the case during the Industrial Revolution, when a number of different inventions led to unprecedented economic growth.

One of the most important inventions of the Industrial Revolution was the steam engine. The steam engine allowed for factories to be built away from water sources, and it also made it possible to power trains and ships. Another key invention was the spinning jenny, which increased the efficiency of textile production.

Other notable inventions from this period include the telegraph, which revolutionized communication; photography, which changed the way we view the world; and the gasoline-powered internal combustion engine, which would eventually lead to the automobile.
