The Challenge of Innovation: How do we stay ahead of the curve?
Innovation is a challenge for any organization, but it's especially hard to keep up with the curve when it comes to technology. Many times, innovation can come from scratch or from taking an existing product and changing its features or design. But whether it's something as simple as a new way of packaging food or a transformed business model, staying ahead of the curve can be tricky.
One way to overcome this challenge is to build on what others have done before. This can be done through collaboration and learning from others, as well as by listening carefully to what customers want and need. It's also important to focus on what customers want most, rather than just trying to please everyone.

There are several ways that an organization can stay ahead of the curve when it comes to innovation.

The 4 types of ideas: creative, critical, problem-solving, and emotional
Creative ideas are always intoxicating, and can be a great way to get your creative juices flowing. However, it's important to be careful with what you create – too much creativity can lead to problems. Here are four types of ideas that can help you get your creative juices flowing: problem-solving ideas, emotional ideas, and critical ideas.
Problem-solving Ideas: 
1) Come up with ways to make the existing structure of your business more efficient or effective. This could mean finding ways to cut costs or improve efficiency, or coming up with new ways to appeal to customers. 
2) Use your creativity in order to come up with solutions to problems that have been bothering your customers for years. For example, if you're a restaurant, come up with new menu items that appeal specifically to people who are struggling financially.
