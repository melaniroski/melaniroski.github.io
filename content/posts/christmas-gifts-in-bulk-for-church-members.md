Conclusion
Innovation is not a new concept. It has been around since the beginning of time. However, it has only recently become a buzzword in the business world.
Innovation is the process of taking an idea and turning it into a reality. It is about creating something new or improving upon something that already exists. Innovation can be big or small. It can be something as simple as a new way to make a cup of coffee or as complex as developing a new form of renewable energy.

There are four main types of innovation: product, process, business model, and social. Product innovation is about creating new products or improving upon existing ones. Process innovation is about improving the way things are done. Business model innovation is about changing the way businesses operate. Social innovation is about solving social problems in new and innovative ways.
