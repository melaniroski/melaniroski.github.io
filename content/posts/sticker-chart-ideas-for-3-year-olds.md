Idea for a big goal: What is our biggest goal?
Big goals are powerful tools for getting people to work together and achieve common goals. They can help a team focus on its mission, and create a sense of purpose. 
There are many different ways to create big goals, but here are five tips for creating effective ones: 

1. Start small: Big goals can be created relatively easily if the goal is something that the team is focused on and knows it has a chance of achieving. However, if the goal is something more difficult or time-consuming, it may be more difficult to get everyone together around it. Try starting with something that everyone in the team can understand and achieve. 

2. Break it down: Once the goal has been identified, break it down into smaller tasks that each team member can complete successfully.

The types of creative art
Creative art is a form of expression that is unique to the individual. There are many different types of creative art, each with its own purpose and meaning.
Some common types of creative art include painting, sculpture, photography, and music. Each type of art has its own way of conveying emotion and ideas. Painting, for example, can be used to express feelings or tell a story. Sculpture can be used to create a physical representation of an idea or feeling. Photography can capture a moment in time and Music can convey emotion and tell a story.

Creative art is important because it allows us to express ourselves in ways that words cannot always convey. It is a way to communicate our feelings and ideas to others. It can also be used as a form of therapy, as it can help us to process our emotions and release stress.
