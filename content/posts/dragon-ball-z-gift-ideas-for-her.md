Editing andpublishing: What steps do you take after coming up with creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be a daunting task, but it's important to first take steps to editing and publishing your ideas. Once you've created some great concepts, it's important to make sure that they're properly accessible and saleable. Here are some key steps to follow:
1. Establish your tone and voice. Once you've come up with a good concept, it's important to establish a tone in order to sell it. You don't want your idea to come off as cheesy or written by someone who is just trying to cash in. Be sure that your idea has an interesting plot, strong visuals, and interesting dialogue.

2. Research your marketability. Once you have a solid tone and voice, it's time to research the marketability of your ideas. Do you have an existing audience? Are your concepts easy to understand?
