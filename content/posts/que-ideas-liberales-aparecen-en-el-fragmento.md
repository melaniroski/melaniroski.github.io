Generating Ideas: Ways to come up with new ideas.
There are a number of ways to come up with new ideas. One way is to brainstorm with others. This can be done in a group setting or by yourself. Another way to generate new ideas is to do a mind map. This is where you take a blank piece of paper and draw a circle in the middle of it. Then, you start brainstorming around the central idea, branching off into different areas. You can also look for inspiration in other places, such as books, magazines, websites, etc. If you’re stuck, try taking a walk or doing something completely unrelated to what you’re working on to clear your mind and come back fresh.

The three Cs of creativity: Concept, Craft, and Color
Creativity is all about coming up with new and creative ways to approach a problem or achieve a goal. It can be found in everything from making art to designing costumes. In order for creativity to thrive, it needs two key components: concept and craft. Concept is the overall idea of what the piece will look like and how it will be used. Craft is the actual creation of the piece, from its conception to its completion. Finally, color is a critical factor in creating an effective work of art. By understanding these three components, creators can better focus on their creativity and produce pieces that are both unique and engaging.
