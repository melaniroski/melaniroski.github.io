How to keep your home clean and organized:
Keeping your home clean is not only easy but can also be fun. There are a variety of ways to keep your home clean, and some are easier than others. Here are two diy ideas that can help keep your home clean and organized:
1. Add a cleaning supplies organizer to the wall near the sink. This will help you see what supplies need to be cleaned and which ones can wait until later.
2. Make a list of all your family’s food allergies and grocery store favorites in a grocery-store-provided bag or container. This will make it easier for you to know what items need to be picked up from the store and which ones can wait until later.

The concept of brainstroming: what it is, how it works, and how to use it
Brainstroming is a term that refers to the act of focusing one’s attention on one specific topic and then taking deep, calming breaths. It can be used as a tool for focus, relaxation, and problem-solving. Brainstroming can be done in any situation, but it is most effective when used during meditation or stress relief. Here are five tips for using brainstroming to achieve success:
1. Make sure you have an EMPATHY FOR THE TOPIC YOU ARE FOCUSING ON.

Before beginning brainstroming, it is important to have an understanding of the topic you are trying to focus on. If you don’t care about the issue at hand, your mind will become clouded with distractions and it will be difficult to find the energy necessary to focus on the task at hand.
