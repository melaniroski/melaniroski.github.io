What is invention?
Invention is the process of creating something new from something that already exists. Invention ideas can come from anything, from a simple idea to an innovative design. There are many different ways to come up with invention ideas, and each one has its own advantages and disadvantages. Here are some examples: 
1. Inventor: This is the person who comes up with the original idea for the product or service. They may have been working on the same problem for a while and have come up with a better way to do it. 
2. Patenting: This is when someone else comes up with a similar idea to yours, but they have filed for a patent so that you can use their ideas legally. This can give you some control over your invention and make sure it's considered as an original work of art by the public.

Types of Innovation: What are the different types and how do they impact business?
Innovation is a process of creating something new, often as part of an effort to improve or change an organization or industry. There are three types of innovation: incremental, disruptive, and evolutionary. Incremental innovation is when companies improve upon existing products or processes. Disruptive innovation is when a new product or service completely changes the way people do business. Evolutionary innovation refers to the gradual improvement of products and services over time.
The different types of innovation can have different impacts on businesses. Incremental innovation can lead to increased sales and profits, while disruptive innovation can lead to losses for companies that don't react quickly enough. Evolutionary innovation often results in improved customer satisfaction over time because it leads to better products that customers find more useful over time.
