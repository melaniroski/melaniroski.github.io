Conclusion: Ideas can be a powerful force for change in your creative career.
Creative careers are constantly evolving and developing, which often means that new ideas and strategies surface. Whether you're a freelance artist or an author, there's always room for growth and change. Here are some final thoughts on how to stay motivated in your creative career:
1) Take a step back and ask yourself what you want to achieve. After all, if you don't want to achieve anything, why bother working at all? If you can't answer this question without getting lost in thought, it might be better not to start with any creative goals at all. Just because something sounds challenging doesn't mean it's worth trying!
2) Get out there and meet people who share your creative vision.
