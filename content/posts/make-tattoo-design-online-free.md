Home decorating ideas: From simple to intricate
Start with the basics: A home is a place of refuge, and comfort. You should make it your own by filling it with comfortable and stylish pieces that will help you relax and feel at home. Here are some simple but effective home decorating ideas to get you started:
1. Add a design element with an old piece of furniture. Search online or in stores for pieces that are already in good condition and were once used as part of a décor scheme. This can be either a chair or a dresser, as long as it is still in good condition and has not been updated in years. Place the piece near the entrance of your home so that people coming home see it first before getting too lost in all the other pieces on your walls.

2. Keep things fresh by using new products and trends from time to time.

The creative process: How does the creative process work?
Creative ideas come to life when artists and writers share their thoughts, feelings and experiences with one another. The creative process begins with inspiration, which is the first step in developing a creative idea. Next, the artist or writer must come up with a unique concept that will capture the attention of others. Once the idea has been captured, it’s time for the writer or artist to flesh out the idea into a full-blown story or novel. Finally, unless there’s an incredible lucky streak, every book or story has to be well-researched and Fallon writes about creating new ideas on a daily basis - whether that’s coming up with an original character or imagining what might happen if she were ever given the opportunity to work on a project her own choosing.
