Why it's important to have a growth plan
It's important to have a growth plan because it sets expectations for the future and helps you stay on track. By knowing what you want, and how to get there, you can create an achievable plan that will help your business grow. Here are three key ideas to help build your growth plan: 
1. Know your industry and where you fit in. Knowing where your business is in the market and what competition is doing will help you determine what needs to be done next in order for your business to stay afloat. 
2. Create a market research strategy. Doing market research will help identify which channels work best for your audience and which ones need more attention or marketing investment. Doing this before starting any new project helps minimize surprises later on. 
3. Set realistic goals and timetables.
