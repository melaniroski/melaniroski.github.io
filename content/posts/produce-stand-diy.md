The 1950s were a time when AI was in its early developmental stages; however, it wasn’t until the 1960s that advancements began to occur in machine learning. However, this progress was slowed by two factors: the Cold War and concerns about how AI could be used for harm. The 1970s saw significant advancements made in AI; however, these advances were met with backlash from some quarters as they were seen as being too advanced for their time.

Patenting: How do you patent an invention?
When patenting an invention, there are a few things to keep in mind. One is the idea behind the invention - what is it? Another is the protection that is granted by law - what kind of protection? And finally, how do you go about getting these protections in place? Here are some tips for each: 
- Do your research: Before you file a patent application, it's important to do your research and understand the different types of patents available. There are many different ways to protect an invention, so don't be afraid to start fielding questions from potential patentees about what they can and cannot do. 
- File early: filed early will help get your application filed on time and protected as soon as possible. If you wait too long, other applicants may have already filed their applications, causing your application to languish in the Patent Office for years.
