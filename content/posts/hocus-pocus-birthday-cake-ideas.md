Causes and Effects of Innovation
Innovation can have both positive and negative effects on economies. Sometimes, innovation can lead to new ideas and products that are better than what is currently available. However, sometimes innovation can also lead to companies becoming too comfortable with their current products and services, or even failing to take advantage of new opportunities that come along.

Conclusion
A good conclusion is the final ingredient in a creative work. It gives the audience a sense of closure and resolution, and can leave them feeling satisfied or even uplifted. A weak conclusion, on the other hand, can leave the audience feeling let down and dissatisfied.
To create a strong conclusion, start by thinking about what you want your audience to take away from your work. What are the main points you want to make? Once you know what you want to say, find a way to say it that is both memorable and impactful.

End with a bang, not a whimper. A powerful image, striking turn of phrase, or thought-provoking question can all make for a memorable conclusion. Whatever you do, don't simply repeat what came before or restate your thesis in a boring way.

What are some benefits of innovation?
Innovation has many benefits for businesses and individuals. Today, innovation is often seen as a good thing, as it can help businesses improve their products or services, increase efficiency, and create new ideas. However, there are some drawbacks to innovation that businesses must be aware of. For example, innovations can lead to increased costs, lower customer satisfaction rates, or even decreased sales.

Brainstroming (So what?) is a process that occurs when the brain migrates from one part of your brain to another. In some cases, this migration can be beneficial; for example, during puberty, the brain shifts from the frontal lobe to the temporal lobe. But in other cases, it can create problems. For example, if you are a math genius and want to be a financial advisor, your brain might move to the temporal lobe in order to better process numbers.

Definition of innovation: A new way of doing things
Innovation is the alteration of the way something is done, or the creation of a new product or service. Innovation can be seen as a way to improve efficiency, lower costs, create new products and services, or to solve problems that have been unsolved. Over time, innovation has become an essential part of technological progress and has led to advances in a variety of industries.
There are several definitions of innovation that are used by different groups and individuals. One definition is "the process by which new ideas, products or services are created." This definition includes both the idea that innovation takes place in addition to existing technologies, as well as the idea that it is not limited to any one sector but can encompass a wide range of industries. Another definition is "a sudden change in state from one having existed for some time before" which could refer to changes in business models or technology.
