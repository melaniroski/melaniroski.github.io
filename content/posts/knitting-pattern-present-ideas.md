Taking Action: How do you take action when you have creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from new products to a better way to do things. When you have creative ideas, it can be hard to know what to do with them. Here are three tips for taking action on your ideas:
1. Research your idea thoroughly before starting anything. This will help you understand the feasibility of the idea and whether or not it is something that is possible or even desirable.

2. Make a prototype of your idea. This will give you a rough idea of how your product or service will look and feel. You can then test this out on customers or see if there is enough demand for the idea to actually start manufacturing it.

3. Take action! Once you have some prototypes and data, it’s time to take action!

creating a plan: What steps should you take to create a plan for your creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything that you want them to be, but there are a few key steps you should take in order to create a plan for your creative ideas. First, identify what kind of ideas you want to pursue. Once you have a solid idea of what you want to create, it’s time to start thinking about how you will go about pursuing those ideas. 
Next, think about the resources you will need in order to pursue your creative ideas. What tools and equipment do you need in order to begin working on your projects? If you don’t have any tools or equipment, it’s important to find someone who does and ask them for help. Once you have the basics set up, it’s time to start thinking about the deadline that you will be wanting your project done by.
