The 2016 presidential election was a watershed moment for the United States, with two new candidates: Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. The election of Sanders signals a new era for progressive politics, as he ran on a platform of Wall Street reform and fighting for the middle class. Clinton, meanwhile, ran as a centrist candidate who would continue President Barack Obama’s policies. In spite of these differences, both candidates will likely face many challenges inOffice.

Conclusion: Why should we care about invention?
Invention is the creative process of coming up with a new idea or design. It can be anything from a new product to a new way of doing something. The invention of the printing press was an incredible event in human history, and it is also responsible for many medical advances. There are countless other examples that can be provided, but the point is that invention is important.
There are several reasons why innovation should be taken seriously. First, innovation allows companies and countries to come up with new products and technologies faster than they would otherwise be able to. Second, it helps businesses make money by creating new ideas and products that people will want to buy. Third, innovation can help scientists learn more about how the world works and how to better understand problems. Finally, innovation can help society function more efficiently – for example, by developing new ways of warfare or managing social networks.
