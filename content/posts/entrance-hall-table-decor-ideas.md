Defining creativity
What is creativity? It’s a question that has been asked for centuries and one that still does not have a solid answer. The definition of creativity has eluded artists, scientists, philosophers, and thinkers for years. But why?
Part of the reason why it’s so difficult to define creativity is because it means different things to different people. For some, creativity is about coming up with new and innovative ideas. For others, it’s about expressing yourself in a unique and original way.

But despite the difficulty in defining it, there are some commonalities that all definitions of creativity share. Creativity is often seen as a process of turning something ordinary into something extraordinary. It’s about taking something that already exists and making it better or transforming it into something completely new.

what brainstorming is, how to do it
Brainstorming is a technique used to generate ideas for a project or problem. To brainstorm, you simply need to allow your mind to wander and come up with as many ideas as possible. There are no wrong answers in brainstorming, so don't worry about being too creative. Just let your thoughts flow and see where they take you.
To get started, find a quiet place where you can relax and focus on the task at hand. Then, set a timer for 10-15 minutes and start writing down whatever comes to mind. Don't worry about editing or critiquing your ideas at this stage; just let them flow freely. Once the timer goes off, you can start looking through your list of ideas and identifying which ones are the most promising.
