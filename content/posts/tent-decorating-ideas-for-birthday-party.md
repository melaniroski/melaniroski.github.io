Summary: Why is it so important to have ideas? What are the benefits of using them, and what are some steps you can take to get started?
Ideas are important, but they can also be dangerous. If you don't have any, you'll be at a disadvantage in your competition. To have ideas is to be flexible and creative, but it's also to be open-minded and willing to change. There are a few key benefits of using ideas: 
1) You will be more prepared for anything that comes your way. When you have an idea in mind, you're already ahead of the competition because you know what you want. They may not, and that's okay! The key is to stay motivated and continue working on it until you've got something good going on. 

2) You will learn more quickly. When you have an idea, your brain starts working overtime trying to come up with a solution.

What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from new ways of looking at an old problem to taking the opposite approach to an existing idea and seeing what happens. Sometimes these ideas can come from simply thinking about something different and seeing what comes out. There are so many creative ideas out there it's hard to know where to start! Here are a few examples: 
1. Try a new perspective on an old problem. When you look at something from a different angle, often the solution is obvious but you may not have thought of it before. This is where creativity comes in – trying things that others may have thought of as impossible or not worth trying. 
2. Make something that no one has ever done before. Something that is different but also traditional or familiar enough so people can feel comfortable with using it.
