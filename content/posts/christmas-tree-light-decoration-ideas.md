Or, someone might come up with a new way to make something work. There are so many different definitions for inventions, it's hard to say which one is the most accurate. But, whatever the definition may be, an invention is always something good that somebody came up with to improve the world.

Tips for improving the appearance of your home
Looking to improve the appearance of your home? Here are a few tips to help!
1. Make use of natural light - All homes benefit from natural light, whether they're for sleeping or working in. In order to create this light, start by using windows and doors that open freely, and then keep your curtains and window treatments open.

2. Be creative - Not all home improvement projects are created equal. If you're looking to spruce up your space with some new decorating ideas, be sure to take into account what's important to you and what you can do with minimal effort. Try focusing on details like draperies or fabrics instead of overly-large changes.

3. Use common sense - When it comes to home decoration, be aware of the pitfalls that can often lead to a less-than-appealing final product.
