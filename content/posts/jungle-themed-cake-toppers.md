Definition of creativity in the business world: How do creativity and business connect?
Creativity and business are intertwined in a lot of ways. Sometimes it's difficult to define what creativity actually is, but there is definitely a connection between the two. 
In the business world, creativity is often used as a synonym for innovation. Innovation is the process of coming up with new ideas or concepts that might not have been thought of before. In order to be successful, businesses need to be innovative in their approach to their product and services. For example, Apple has always been known for their innovative design and products. They are constantly inspired by new technology and how it can be used to improve people's lives. This allowed them to continue expanding their empire even after they were first introduced to the world. 

On the other hand, creativity also goes beyond just doing things differently or having novel ideas.

The types of creative art
Creative art is a form of expression that is unique to the individual. There are many different types of creative art, each with its own purpose and meaning.
Some common types of creative art include painting, sculpture, photography, and music. Each type of art has its own way of conveying emotion and ideas. Painting, for example, can be used to express feelings or tell a story. Sculpture can be used to create a physical representation of an idea or feeling. Photography can capture a moment in time and Music can convey emotion and tell a story.

Creative art is important because it allows us to express ourselves in ways that words cannot always convey. It is a way to communicate our feelings and ideas to others. It can also be used as a form of therapy, as it can help us to process our emotions and release stress.
