Creativedesigners on the go
Creativedesigners are on the go, and that means they need to be creative when it comes to their work. Whether they're working from home or on the go, creativity is key to success. Here are four ways creative designers can keep their work organized and on track:
1. Create a To-Do List: A to-do list can help keep things organized and on track. Not only does it make life easier, but keeping a to-do list can also help you stay inspired as you work.

2. Use NiceNotes: Another great way to keep things organized is using NiceNotes. Not only do they look pretty, but they also have a variety of uses (such as for brainstorming).

3. Keep Workspaces Clean: One way to stay focused while working is by keeping your workspace clean.

What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas are always a good thing, especially when they can help improve someone's day-to-day life. Here are some of the best ideas around: 
1. Make a list of what you need in order to start painting or sculpting. This will give you a starting point for creating something that you're passionate about and can work on for hours. 
2. Draw inspiration from other cultures and their art styles. This can help you to create pieces that are unique and interesting. 
3. Take a walk outside and take in the atmosphere. This can provide you with many different ideas for art projects that you may not have considered before. 
4. Use technology to your advantage! If you have an Instagram or Facebook account, start postulating creative ways to use it in your artwork instead of just letting it be an eyesore.
