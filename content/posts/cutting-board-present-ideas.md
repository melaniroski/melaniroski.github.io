Trends in Business Processes: How will business processes continue to change and impact businesses?
Business processes have always been changing and impactful. However, there are new trends that businesses should be aware of in order to continue to thrive in the future. Examples of these trends include:
1. Automation and artificial intelligence will continue to influence business processes. This will allow businesses to save time and money by using automated tools instead of human employees.

2. New regulations will also impact business processes. These regulations may require businesses to change their ways or face penalties from government officials.
