The Invention of the Electric Shock guitar
Electric shock guitars were invented in the late 1800s by George Lukacs, a musician and inventor. Lukacs had been playing an electric guitar that used alternating current (A.C.) to create sound, and he realized that electric guitars could be used for amplification. In 1892, Lukacs developed his first model electric guitar, the Electric Guitar Company's "Lukacs Guitars." The guitar was designed to be affordable and easy to play, with a single-coil pickup and a simple design. In 1934, Lukacs died at the age of 83, but his electric guitar remains one of the most significant instruments in history.

The definition of creativity
Creativity is a mental process which refers to the ability to come up with new ideas, solutions or products. It can be described in different ways but ultimately it is what makes us unique and makes us stand out from the rest. Creative art is often seen as an area where creativity flourishes, as it offers an escape from reality and allows people to become creative problem solvers. In order to be considered creative, an artist must have a strong imagination, be able to see things in a new light and be willing to experiment.
