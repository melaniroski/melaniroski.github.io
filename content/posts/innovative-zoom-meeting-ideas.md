Overcoming obstacles to thinking big
In order to think big, we must first overcome the obstacles that prevent us from doing so. These obstacles can be both internal and external.
Internal obstacles include self-doubt, negative thinking, and a lack of confidence. We must learn to silence our inner critic and believe in ourselves before we can achieve great things.

External obstacles include other people's negativity, skepticism, and doubt. When pursuing a big idea, it is important to surround yourself with positive people who will support and encourage you.

By overcoming these obstacles, we open ourselves up to limitless possibilities. Once we start thinking big, there is no telling what we can achieve.

Everyone has their own unique approach to creative expression. However, there are some general approaches which work best for some people while others may find them more successful. Here are four examples: 

1) Solo artists – Solo artists often have a more personal style and can be more creative when working on their own. This type of artist is often better suited for projects that are low-pressure and do not require a lot of collaboration. 
2) Group creators – Group creators work together to create new ideas and share any feedback they may have. This type of group is perfect forprojects that need unanimity in order to be successful. 
3) Front-to-back creators – Front-to-back creators work on one project at a time in order to achieve the most success.

 There are many different types of patent applications, but the most popular ones include: 
-Patent application for a new product 
-Patent application for a process or structure

There is no set number of patent applications that are filed in any given year, but it is generally safe to assume that there will be at least one type of patent application filed every month.
