what are big ideas?
What are Big Ideas?
In education, a big idea is a broad concept that provides a unifying structure for a lesson or unit. It helps students connect new information to what they already know and understand. Big ideas should be open-ended and complex, allowing students to explore them in depth.

Big ideas help students see the world in new ways and make connections between different concepts. They encourage higher-level thinking and promote deeper understanding. When students can articulate the big ideas in a subject, they have mastered the essential content and skills.

What are the benefits of having ideas?
Ideas can be a powerful tool for improving business efficiency, creativity, and overall productivity. By having more ideas, businesses can move faster and make better decisions when it comes to product innovation, marketing campaigns, and even store design. In fact, the more ideas a business has, the harder it is to stay ahead of the competition. Here are four reasons why you should start taking advantage of all those innovative juices:
1. More Ideas Means Faster Product Development: When a business has more ideas on its plate, they're more likely to come up with better products that meet customer needs. Not only do they have more options to consider when coming up with new products, but they also have time to test different concepts and see which ones work best before moving forward with an actual product.
