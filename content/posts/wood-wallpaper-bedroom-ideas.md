The benefits of brainstorming
Brainstorming is a great way to generate new ideas, and can be done either alone or in a group. When brainstorming, it is important to suspend judgment and allow all ideas to be considered. This can help prevent “groupthink”, where people only consider ideas that are similar to what they already know. Brainstorming can also help people come up with creative solutions to problems.
There are many different ways to brainstorm, but one popular method is called “brainstorming by free association”. This involves coming up with words or phrases that are related to the topic at hand, and then using those words or phrases to generate new ideas. Another method is called “brainstorming by analogy”, which involves thinking of similar situations or problems and how they were solved.

Different types of innovation:
Innovation is a key term in business. It can be defined as the process of making something new and better. There are many types of innovation, some of which are more common than others. 
One type of innovation is product innovation. This refers to the development of a new product that does not already exist. In this case, the company must come up with a new way to make their product and market it to customers. 

Another type of innovation is process innovation. This occurs when companies improve the way they do something, such as developing a new manufacturing process or changing how they distribute products. Process innovations can have a big impact on the efficiency and profitability of businesses. 

Finally, there is service innovation. This refers to the development of new services that could not be produced by companies alone, such as software development or customer service.
