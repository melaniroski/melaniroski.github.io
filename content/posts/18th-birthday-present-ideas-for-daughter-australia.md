What is creative art and why should we care?
Creative art is a form of art that is inspired by or based on imagination or creativity. It can be considered an expression of ideas and feelings, and can be used to communicate with others or to entertain oneself. There are many different kinds of creative art, but the most popular ones are painting, sculpture, photography, music, and poetry. Creative artists often use their creative abilities to express their own thoughts and feelings, and to make something that is unique and beautiful. There are many reasons why people should care about creative art, and they include the following: 
1) It can help you learn more about yourself. When you understand how other people's creative processes work, you can begin to develop your own. This will help you become more self-determined and independent, which is important for both personal growth and career development.
