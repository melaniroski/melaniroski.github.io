What is the new idea?
The new idea is to use a smartwatch as a fitness tracker. People wear trackers all the time, so why not wear one on their wrist? This would be great for people who are already healthy and want to keep track of their fitness and activity levels. Another benefit of this technology is that it could be used as a communication device. You could use it to text or call someone while you are working out, or even while you are lying in bed.

What is innovation?
Innovation is the process of creating a new product or service that is different from the ones currently in use. Innovation can be seen in everything from medical treatments to fashion trends.
There are a few things to keep in mind when it comes to innovation. The first is that innovation should be incremental, meaning that it shouldn't come from one big leap forward but rather incremental changes that improve upon the current system. Second, innovation should be based on customer feedback and not just on what someone thinks is best for their business.

Big ideas are the lifeblood of any startup. They're the ones that push the envelope, inspire and drive innovation, and give founders a new way to think about their business. But when it comes to big ideas, there's one key rule that startups must follow: always have more than one. A single idea can be limiting, especially if it's based on an old model or a preconceived notion.
