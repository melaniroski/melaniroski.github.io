How do we turn creativity into results?
In order to be creative, you need to have a clear idea of what you want to create. If you don't know what it is that you're trying to create, it's hard to get started. Sometimes creativity can come from just taking ideas and turning them into something real. Sometimes all you need is a good starting point, and then you can start creating things from there.

Brainstroming can be caused by a variety of factors, but the most common cause is a lack of focus. People who have brainstroming can lose focus on everything from their work to their personal life. This can lead to problems at work, social consequences at home, and even physical health issues.
