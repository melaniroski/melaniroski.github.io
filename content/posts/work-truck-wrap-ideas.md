The benefits of being creative:
According to a study done by the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, being creative has many benefits. Some of these benefits include: improved communication skills, better problem solving abilities, higher grades in school and increased self-esteem.
Being creative can help you communicate better. When you have an idea, you have to be able to explain it to others clearly so they can understand what you’re trying to say. This requires good communication skills.

Being creative can also help you solve problems better. If you can think outside the box, you’ll be able to come up with solutions that others might not think of. This is a valuable skill in any field.

Finally, being creative can lead to higher grades in school.
