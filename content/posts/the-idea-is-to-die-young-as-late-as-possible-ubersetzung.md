What are the benefits of big ideas?
Believe it or not, big ideas are often the most successful. They are persistent, imaginative, and can be tailored to specific needs. When used correctly, big ideas can change the way we do things, and they can be a major force for productivity and innovation. Here are four examples of how big ideas have helped businesses grow and improve their performance: 
1. The iPod was a big idea when it was first introduced in 2001. It quickly became one of the most popular music players in the world, revolutionizing music listening habits. 
2. Google’s search engine was a huge success when it was first launched in 1996. It has since become one of the most popular search engines on the internet, helping people find information and products anywhere on Earth.

Benefits of creativity: What do you gain from being creative?
Creativity can be defined as the ability to come up with new ideas, ideas that are different from what is currently accepted and/or common, or anything that is original. Creative individuals often have a better imagination and are more creative than those who do not. There are many benefits to being creative, some of which include: increased productivity due to the increased variety of ideas, improved communication and problem-solving skills because of how you can come up with new solutions quickly, and even better grades in school because creativity often leads to new ways of thinking that may be unorthodox but are still effective.
