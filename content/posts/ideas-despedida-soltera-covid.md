How do you know if your ideas are big enough?
Big ideas can be hard to come by, but they can be incredibly powerful. If you have a great idea for a new product or service, the first step is to find the right people to create it and market it. Once you've got your idea out there, it'll be up to you to see if it becomes a reality. If you're not sure if your idea is big enough, there are a few ways to determine whether or not it's possible to execute successfully. 
The first way is through market research. This process involves collecting data about what people want and how they feel about products or services. Once you've gathered this information, you can begin developing an idea for something that will appeal to all types of people. 

Another way of determining whether or not your idea is big enough is through financial analysis.

What are some ideas?
Ideas can be anything from what you want your business to do, to how you can make your product or service better. When it comes to starting a business, there are endless options and possibilities for what you can do. Here are some tips for getting started: 
1. Make an idea list- This will help you come up with ideas for your business that have nothing to do with the products or services that you offer. It can also be helpful to think about how you could improve upon what others have done before you.

2. Get creative- Start by coming up with new ways that you could market and sell your product or service. What if there was a more efficient way to ship products? How about developing a unique selling proposition (USP)? This will help get people interested in your product or service and increase sales potential.
