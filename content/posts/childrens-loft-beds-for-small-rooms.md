Peterson ran for 124 yards on 14 carries and Rudolph caught a pass for 79 yards. This showed that it is possible to run the ball effectively and have success with tight ends. These results show that big ideas can work if put into practice.

Definition: Creative art is any form of art that is not based on literal or historical reality.
Creative art is any form of art that is not based on literal or historical reality. This includes both expressively creative art and abstraction. Expressively creative art often uses creativity to escape from reality. An example of this would be a painting that doesn't represent a real-world object, but instead usesimagery or myth to create a unique experience. An example of an abstract artist's work could be a painting without any specific objects or movements, allowing the viewer to imagine what it might look like.
