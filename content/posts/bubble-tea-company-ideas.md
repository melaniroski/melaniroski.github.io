What to do with ideas: From brainstorming to taking them to market
Ideas are like stars in a sky. They can bring light to a dark room or help you turn a negative into a positive. However, like most things in life, they come with baggage. Sometimes the baggage is good, and other times it’s bad. Here are four tips for dealing with ideas:
1. Be open to new ideas 
No one ever has all the answers to every question or problem. “Open your mind” and let new ideas flow in. Even if they don’t work out, that doesn’t mean you can’t learn from them. 
2. Take the time to study what worked before 
Studying what others have done can help you develop your own idea without feeling bound by former solutions or failures.

The definition of art: Who makes it and what does it represent?
Creative art is a term that has been bandied about for a long time, with no one really having a clear definition of what it actually means. In many cases, it seems to be subjective and up to the artist themselves what constitutes as creative art. However, in spite of its nebulous nature, there are some key factors that seem to be essential to the definition of creative art. These include the artists' own personal vision and feelings towards their work, as well as the medium or technique used. Whether it's painting or sculpture, music or photography - any form of creative art can be said to have its own unique meaning and personality.

How to Pitch an Idea: Tips for successful pitches
Ideas are a powerful tool for selling and developing products. If you can come up with good ones, your pitch will be more successful. Here are some tips for creating an idea pitch that will be successful:
1. Start by identifying what your product or service does that others don't. This can be difficult, but it's important to think about the problem someone else is trying to solve.
2. Find a analogy or metaphor that resonates with your target audience and helps explain how your product or service would solve that problem.
3. Be clear and concise when describing what your product or service does and how it would benefit customers. Your target audience will appreciate clarity in their purchase decision-making process.
4. Demonstrate why people should buy your product or service instead of those of your competitors.

The power of big ideas
There are certain ideas that have the power to change the world. These are the big ideas. And while some people may think that only governments and large organizations have the ability to enact change on a global scale, history has shown us time and again that it is often the power of an individual with a big idea that can make the biggest difference.
One person with a big idea can start a movement that changes the way we think about an issue or problem. We’ve seen it happen with civil rights, women’s rights, and environmental issues. It is one person who has the courage to stand up and say “this is wrong” or “this needs to change” who can start a chain reaction that leads to real and lasting change.

Invention: What are the four ways that invention happens?
Invention can be defined as the process of coming up with a new idea or design that is not currently existing. Invention occurs in many different ways, but four are particularly important: Creative Art, Technology, Business and Science. 
Creative Art occurs when people come up with new ideas or designs that they never would have thought of before. This can be done through brainstorming, drawing inspiration from others, or even just looking at something and thinking of potential solutions. Technology happens when scientists find new ways to make things work better and faster. Business happens when companies decide how to use their invention and create products that people will want to buy. Science happens when scientists figure out how things work and learn how to make them work better.
