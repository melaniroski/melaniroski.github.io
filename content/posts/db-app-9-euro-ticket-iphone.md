Types of creativity: How do different types of creativity differ?
Creativity is a relative term. Some people may say that creativity is the ability to come up with new ideas, while others might say that creativity is the process of coming up with new ways to do something. There are many different types of creativity, and it all comes down to what you are looking for in a creative project. Here are three examples: art, design, and technology.
Art: Art is the creation of objects or pictures that are not related to anything else in the world. It can be done in any form, whether it’s making art out of everyday things like paperclips or painting an entire room with just some colors and shapes.

Design: Design is the process of creating designs that are unique and effective. It can be done through drawings, paintings, or even software programs.

The New Workplace: What are the new trends in work?
The new workplace is a place where employees can be their best selves. There are many different ideas for the new workplace, but some of the most popular ones include:
1. In-person meetings: Company executives and managers now often hold face-to-face meetings to discuss important business issues. This allows employees to have a more direct conversation with their superiors.

2. Virtual work environments: Employees can now work from home or from any location in the world. This allows companies to save on office space and time.

3. Online applications: Companies are increasingly using online applications to connect with potential employees. This makes it easier for companies to find qualified workers and eliminates the need for physical interviews.
