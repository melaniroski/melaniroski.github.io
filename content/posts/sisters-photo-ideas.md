what is innovation?
Innovation is the process of introducing something new into the market. This can be a new product, a new service, or a new way of doing things. Innovation is about taking risks and making changes in order to improve the way we do things.
Innovation is essential for businesses to grow and remain competitive. It allows businesses to create new products and services that customers want and need. Innovation also helps businesses to improve their processes and become more efficient.

However, innovation is not always easy. It requires businesses to think outside the box, take risks, and invest in research and development. But the rewards of innovation can be great, both for businesses and for society as a whole.
