What is innovation and how does it differ from other forms of creativity?
Innovation is a term that has been used for different things in different times. It can be considered to be two different concepts, although they have many similarities. Innovation can be defined as the process of coming up with a new solution to a problem. This solution can be something that was previously thought impossible or something that was not even considered possible before. Innovation is also often described as being different from other forms of creativity, which is what this article will focus on. Other forms of creativity may involve coming up with ideas or solutions that are not practical or feasible. Innovation, on the other hand, involves coming up with a new and innovative solution to a problem that people have never seen before.

What is creativity?
Creativity is the process of coming up with new ideas, concepts or solutions to problems. It can be defined in many ways, but often it refers to the ability to come up with something new and original. Creative people are often thought of as those who are able to come up with new and innovative ideas, but that’s not all that creativity involves. In fact, creativity can also refer to the ability to approach problem solving in a different way or the ability to come up with innovative ways of tackling old problems.
So what exactly is creativity? It’s an adjective that can describe a wide range of things, but many experts believe that creativity is key to success both professionally and personally. There are several components to creativity: time management, planning and focus.

Defining creativity
What is creativity? It’s a question that has been asked for centuries and one that still does not have a solid answer. The definition of creativity has eluded artists, scientists, philosophers, and thinkers for years. But why?
Part of the reason why it’s so difficult to define creativity is because it means different things to different people. For some, creativity is about coming up with new and innovative ideas. For others, it’s about expressing yourself in a unique and original way.

But despite the difficulty in defining it, there are some commonalities that all definitions of creativity share. Creativity is often seen as a process of turning something ordinary into something extraordinary. It’s about taking something that already exists and making it better or transforming it into something completely new.
