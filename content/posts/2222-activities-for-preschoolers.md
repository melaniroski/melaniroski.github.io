Because creativity is so important, it can be hard to determine which category a person falls into when it comes to art.Some people may see creativity as simply coming up with new ideas or concepts; while others could see creativity as the ability to express oneself in a unique way. It all boils down to what someone considers essential to their artistry.
There are two main categories of creatives- those who come up with ideas and those who create something beautiful. While both types of creatives require some great talent and dedication, there are key differences that set creatives apart from other artists.

The Pros and Cons: How do these new ideas compare and contrast with what is already known?
There are a lot of new ideas out there. Do you know what they all are? Let's take a look. 
One idea is to use technology to help improve education. Another is to create a more sustainable way of living. Plus, there are many more that have not been mentioned yet. So, how do these new ideas compare and contrast with what is already known?

One thing that is different about the new ideas is that they often focus on solving problems instead of creating them. This makes them better at solving problems that have already been solved before, rather than creating new ones from scratch. 

Another difference between the new ideas and what has been done before is that some of the old solutions may not be as effective anymore or may not work as well anymore in the modern world.
