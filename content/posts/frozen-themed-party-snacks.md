Coming Up With Ideas: Offer some tips on how to generate invention ideas.
Inventing something new can be a daunting task, but there are some things you can do to increase your chances of success. First, try to come up with ideas that solve a problem you encounter in your everyday life. Chances are, if you can find a solution to your own problem, others will be interested in your invention as well. Also, don't be afraid to brainstorm with friends or family members; two heads are better than one when it comes to coming up with new ideas. Finally, keep a notebook or journal handy at all times so you can jot down any inventive thoughts that pop into your head; you never know when inspiration will strike!

Creative Process: How do you come up with creative ideas?
Creative ideas come to us in all shapes and forms - they can be things we never even thought of, or something that was sitting at the back of our mind but we just couldn't seem to get started on.
Whatever the creative process is, it involves some kind of brainstorming or problem solving. Once you've come up with a few ideas, it's important to work on those ideas until you have a good one. And then it's onto the next step - finding a way to put those ideas into action.
