Creativity in the arts: What makes a piece of art creative?
Creativity in the arts can be defined in a variety of ways, but one definition that is most often used is that creativity involves deviation from the norm. In art, this deviation can come from simply rearranging or adapting pieces of material, to using new voices or ideas to create something new and/or different. Whether it’s a creative idea for a painting or a piece of music, deviations from the norm are what make art creative.
