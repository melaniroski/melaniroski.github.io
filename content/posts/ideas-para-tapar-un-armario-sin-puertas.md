The Use of Invention: What are some examples?
Invention is the use of a creative idea, or a new method or process, to produce a product or service. Invention can come from anywhere: in your mind, in your backyard, on the internet, or even from someone you know. 
There are many examples of invention. For example, think about the wheel- an invention that changed the way we move around. There are also inventions that have had huge impacts on society and the world like the telephone, antibiotics, and jet engines- all of which were invented by people who were not just working on their own but were part of a team. 
Inventions can be really amazing or really terrible. But they always have a big impact because they help us do things that we couldn't do before and they make our lives easier.

There is something about brains that make them so fascinating. While we can't understand every single neuron in our brain, we can study how they work and how they are related to one another. This research has led to the discovery of brainstroming - a type of thinking that occurs when two or more thoughts are working together in your mind and you don't know which one to focus on.
