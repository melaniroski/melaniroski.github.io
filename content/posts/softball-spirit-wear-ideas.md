What are the benefits of having ideas?
Ideas can help you achieve success in any field, even if you don't have a lot of experience. They can also help you get your idea off the ground and into a full-blown business venture. Here are four benefits of having ideas: 
1. You'll be more confident when starting a new project. When you have an idea, it feels like there's something to believe in. This confidence will help you start and finish projects with greater efficiency, and it will make sure that your ideas actually turn into reality. 
2. You'll be more organized when brainstorming new ideas. Having an idea always means that there's a potential solution that you haven't considered before! This will enable you to come up with better ideas for projects, faster than if you didn't think about it at all.

The benefits of brainstorming
Brainstorming is a great way to generate new ideas, and can be done either alone or in a group. When brainstorming, it is important to suspend judgment and allow all ideas to be considered. This can help prevent “groupthink”, where people only consider ideas that are similar to what they already know. Brainstorming can also help people come up with creative solutions to problems.
There are many different ways to brainstorm, but one popular method is called “brainstorming by free association”. This involves coming up with words or phrases that are related to the topic at hand, and then using those words or phrases to generate new ideas. Another method is called “brainstorming by analogy”, which involves thinking of similar situations or problems and how they were solved.
