what is brainstorming?
Brainstorming is a group activity in which members of a team generate ideas and solutions to problems. The term was first coined by Alex Osborn, an advertising executive, in the 1940s. Brainstorming is often used in business settings as a way to encourage creativity and out-of-the-box thinking. 
There are several different methods of brainstorming, but the most common is probably the round robin method, in which each team member takes turns sharing ideas. Other methods include free association, in which participants share ideas without restriction, and brainstorming with constraints, in which participants are given certain parameters within which to generate ideas. 

The effectiveness of brainstorming has been debated by some researchers, who argue that it can lead to conformity and pressure to conform to group norms.

The challenge of creativity: How do we overcome obstacles and reach our creative destination?
Creativity is an essential part of any person's life. It can be used to create things that no one has thought of before or to come up with new ideas for products or services. However, there are often obstacles that stand in the way of reaching our creative destination. Some of the most common obstacles include lack of experience, creativity being blocked by fear, and a lack of support from those around us. How can we overcome these challenges and reach our creative destination? There are a few ways to start with, but each person's journey will be unique. One approach is to find a group of people who share your same interests and/or goals, and ask them to help you brainstorm ideas.
