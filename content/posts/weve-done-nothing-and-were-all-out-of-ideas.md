Types of innovation
There are many types of innovation, each with its own benefits and drawbacks. To get a better understanding of what types of innovation are available, it can be helpful to look at some examples. 
Innovation can come in the form of new products or services, new methods for doing something, or a change in how things are done. There are many different types of innovation available, so it is important to find what best suits your needs and business goals. 

Some benefits of innovation include improving customer service and satisfaction, creating new markets for products or services, expanding the reach of an existing product or service, and increasing productivity. However, there are also risks associated with any type of innovation. For example, if a company over-promises or under-delivers on their new product or service, this could harm their reputation and cause customers to abandon them.
