Tips for creating unique and interesting blog posts: How can you make your posts stand out from the rest?
Creating interesting and unique blog posts is a key part of any online writer’s repertoire. There are a number of ways to go about this, but one way that can really set your blog apart from the rest is by using creative writing techniques. Here are some tips for trying out these techniques:
1. Start with a strong opener. Your first sentence should be intriguing and introduce your readers to the topic at hand.

2. Use verbs tense in your writing to make your words feel more alive. This will help keep your reader engaged and motivated to read on.

3. Think outside the box when it comes to plot points and ideas. Not all blog posts need an obvious solution, and instead, you can use them as a jumping off point for new storylines or characters for your blog post.

what is brainstorming?
Brainstorming is a group activity in which members of a team generate ideas and solutions to problems. The term was first coined by Alex Osborn, an advertising executive, in the 1940s. Brainstorming is often used in business settings as a way to encourage creativity and out-of-the-box thinking. 
There are several different methods of brainstorming, but the most common is probably the round robin method, in which each team member takes turns sharing ideas. Other methods include free association, in which participants share ideas without restriction, and brainstorming with constraints, in which participants are given certain parameters within which to generate ideas. 

The effectiveness of brainstorming has been debated by some researchers, who argue that it can lead to conformity and pressure to conform to group norms.
