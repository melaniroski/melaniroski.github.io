The benefits of creative art: what are they?
Creative art has many benefits for both individuals and society. Here are some of the most common: 
1) It can help improve mental health. People who are creative often have more balanced lives than those who are not, and this is especially true when it comes to their mental health. They may find it easier to cope with stress and anxiety, and they may be less likely to suffer from depression or bipolar disorder.
2) It can help people learn new skills. People who are creative often develop new skills that they would not otherwise be able to use. This is especially true for people who are good at problem-solving or creating things from scratch. These skills can then be put to use in other areas of life, such as in the workplace or in hobbies.
3) It can help people connect with others.

The three types of big ideas: A crazy idea, a good idea, and a bad idea
There are three types of big ideas: crazy, good, and bad. Crazy ideas are always exciting, and can help to change the course of history. Good ideas have the potential to make a big impact on people and the world. However, there is always risk associated with them- some might be great, while others might not be so great after all. But when it comes time to make a decision, it’s important to weigh the risks and benefits of each idea before coming up with a decision.
Bad Ideas are simply terrible, and often have no chance of becoming anything other than infamous failures. They may seem like something that could never work or might even lead to disaster- but in reality, they often do just that. It’s important to be vigilant when assessing any new idea- especially those with such potential for disaster.
