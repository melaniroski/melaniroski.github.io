What is innovation?
Innovation, according to Webster’s Dictionary, is the “the use of new ideas, designs, or methods in a particular activity or enterprise.” Innovation has been identified as one of the most important drivers of economic growth and competitiveness. In today’s economy, innovation is critical for businesses to stay afloat and remain competitive. There are three types of innovation: technological, functional, and organizational.
Technological innovation refers to new ways of doing things such as developing new technology or applying existing technology in a new way. Functional innovation refers to making changes that improve the efficiency or performance of an organization such as increasing productivity or improving customer service. Organizational innovation refers to creating new ways for people to work together such as developing different productivity tools or coming up with unique ways for employees to communicate with each other.
