How can technology help solve these challenges?
Technology has the potential to help solve many of the world’s challenges. This includes improving access to education, improving healthcare, and reducing pollution.

However, technology can help address both of these challenges. For example, Google has developed a project called “Chromecast” which allows users to watch television shows and movies online. This project is a great way for people who are not able to watch television or film in an original way.
