What are the new ideas out there?
In the current political and social climate, there are a number of fresh ideas out there that could change the way we live and work. Here are 5 of them: 
1. A Universal Basic Income: This concept is gaining popularity due to the pressures of mass unemployment and inequality in society. It would provide income to everyone on a sliding scale, with no strings attached.
2. Autonomous Vehicles: This is an idea that has been gaining traction recently due to its potential for reducing traffic congestion and improving public transportation options.
3. Green Energy: The use of green energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydro power has seen a rise in popularity in recent years. This would allow us to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and help address climate change problems.

How to brainstorm effectively.
1. When it comes to brainstorming, there are a few key things to keep in mind in order to make the process as effective as possible. 
2. First and foremost, it’s important to create a relaxed and comfortable environment for everyone involved. This means no judgment, no pressure, and no distractions. 
3. Once you have the right setting, it’s time to start generating ideas. The best way to do this is to encourage free-flowing thought and open-mindedness. 
4. Brainstorming sessions should be all about quantity over quality at first – worry about filtering and refining later on. 
5. It can be helpful to have someone act as a facilitator during the session, keeping things on track and making sure everyone has a chance to share their ideas.

What are some creative techniques?
Creative techniques can be anything from painting to sculpting to writing. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced artist, there are a number of creative techniques that can help you get the best results in your artwork. Here are three examples:
1. Use perspective to create depth and interest in your artwork. Perspective is important when it comes to creating images, so use it to great effect in your paintings and sculptures. By understanding how perspective works, you can exaggerate or avoid details that may not look as important on the surface.

2. Use light and shadow to create moods in your artwork. You can use light and dark tones to create moods in your work, or you can use them simply as means of adding atmosphere and character into your pieces. For example, if you want your artwork to feel suspenseful, try using light shadows against dark backgrounds.
