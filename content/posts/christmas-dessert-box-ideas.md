What are some common mistakes people make when starting a Blog?
There are a few common mistakes people make when starting a blog, and one of the most common is not setting up a good system for tracking posts. This can lead to posts being published without notice or without even having the opportunity to answer questions. Additionally, not having an effective email system in place can prevent people from getting notified about new posts or changes to the blog site. In addition, failing to create a well-written and engaging post can result in readers leaving the site before they have had a chance to see everything that is available.
