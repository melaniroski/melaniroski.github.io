Discussion: What could we do to improve our idea process?
New ideas often come about during brainstorming sessions, and can be a great way to improve our idea process. However, it can be difficult to come up with new ideas on your own. Here are three tips on how to get started:
1. Get feedback from others: When brainstorming, it’s important to take input from other members of the team. This will help you develop ideas that are both based on common interest and workable.

2. Be open to change: sometimes the best ideas don’t fit into what we’ve been told before. Be willing to change your opinion if something seems better or more feasible.

3. Be persistent: despite sometimes being frustrating, nothing is more important than making sure our idea is implemented successfully. Keep at it until you have a great list of proposals that everyone is happy with!

Definition of big ideas: What are some common examples?
Big ideas are ideas that are so big and complex that they can't be fully expressed in words. They might be something as small as a new way of looking at an old problem or as large as a new way to approach an old problem. Whatever their size, big ideas always have the potential to change the course of history.

Invention as an act or process of coming up with a new idea or solution
Invention has been around for centuries, and it is no secret that many creative minds have come up with brilliant new ideas. However, only a small percentage of inventions actually become products or services. This is due to the fact that invention is an act or process of coming up with a new idea or solution. In order to make your invention successful, you must be able to come up with great ideas and have the hustle and determination to work on them tirelessly. If you are able to put in the extra effort, your invention will likely be more successful than those who just sit back and wait for someone else to create something for them.
