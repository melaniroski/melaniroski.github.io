The difference between left brain and right brain thinking:
Most people use both sides of their brain for thinking, but some people tend to use one side more than the other. Left-brain thinkers are usually more logical and analytical, while right-brain thinkers are usually more creative.
Left-brain thinkers tend to be better at things like math and science, because they can break things down into smaller pieces and see the logic behind them. Right-brain thinkers tend to be better at things like art and music, because they can see the big picture and come up with creative ideas.

Both types of thinking are important, and most people use both sides of their brain for different tasks. But if you want to be good at something that requires creativity, then you’ll need to learn how to use your right brain more.

what is creative art?
Creative art is a form of expression that utilizes one or more creative mediums to convey feelings, thoughts, or ideas. The world of creative art is vast and ever-changing, making it one of the most dynamic and exciting areas of human endeavor.
There are countless forms of creative art, each with its own unique purpose and audience. Whether it’s a painting hung in a gallery or a performance piece staged in front of an audience, creative art has the power to provoke emotion and inspire thought.

At its core, creative art is about communication. It’s a way for artists to share their vision with the world, and for audiences to connect with the artist on a deeper level. Whether you’re creating art or simply enjoying it, remember that it has the ability to touch us all in ways that words alone can never hope to achieve.

If you're stuck on what to do next, don't worry—you're not alone. We all have moments where we feel uninspired, whether it's in our personal lives or our work. The good news is, there are plenty of ways to get your creative juices flowing again.
Here are a few ideas to get you started:

2. Talk to someone: When you're feeling lost, talking to someone who is creative can give you some great ideas.
