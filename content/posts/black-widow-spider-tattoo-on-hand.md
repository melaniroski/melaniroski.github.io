How to get great ideas: Take time to think productively, don't rely on external sources, and be open to feedback.
If you're like most people, you go through the motions of thinking productively but don't really get out there and generate new ideas. You might rely on external sources to get your creative juices flowing, or you may be afraid to give feedback because it could mean you're not working in the right direction. If you take the time to think productively, though, all of those assumptions and inhibitions fall away. You can also be open to feedback – even if it's a little bit challenging – because it will help you become better at generating new ideas.

Patenting and registering an invention: What are the likely risks?
Patenting an invention is a process of officially registering a new product or service with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The benefits of patenting an invention include increased protection for your ideas, as well as easier access to potential customers and investors. However, there are a number of potential risks associated with patenting an invention. Here are three key points to consider when Patenting your Invention: 1) The USPTO can take years to review and grant a patent application, so it is important to be prepared for the wait. 2) There is a risk that your idea may not be accepted by the public or other decision-makers. 3) There is also a risk that your idea may not generate enough revenue to cover the costs associated with filing and prosecuting a patent application.
