How will you make sure that your content is useful and engaging?
The content of an article should be useful, engaging and interesting to the reader. It should also be clear, concise and easy to read. Here are 8 tips for making sure that your content is useful, engaging and interesting:
1. Take into account the audience you are addressing. What are the interests of your audience? Are they business owners, consumers or both? When writing for a specific audience, make sure to consider what information will be most effective for them.

2. Use clear language and images to help explain your ideas. People understand words more when they can see them clearly. Try using images throughout your article so that readers can visualize the concepts being discussed.

3. Use originality and creativity when creating new ideas. Don’t plagiarize other people’s work – it won’t make your content any better or more engaging.

Challenges and opportunities for innovation: What are they?
Innovation can be defined as change that brings new opportunities or changes to the way something is done. It can also refer to technological and scientific innovation, which has helped humankind improve their lives in myriad ways. 
Challenges and opportunities for innovation abound, but often times there are unique challenges that need to be addressed in order to achieve the desired outcomes.
