Development: How do you actually develop an invention idea?
When it comes to developing an invention idea, the best way is to do some research and figure out what you want to create. If you have a specific problem that you want to solve, then brainstorm a few possible solutions. However, if you don't know what you're looking for or if you just don't have any ideas, then brainstorming won't help. The best way to come up with an invention idea is by doing some tinkering and experimenting. Once you've had a few prototypes created, it's time to start turning them into a product. By doing this, you'll be able to see how people use your product and see where potential problems might exist.
