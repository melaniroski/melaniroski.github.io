What are the options for ideas?
Ideas are a valuable asset for businesses and individuals. They can be used to generate new ideas, come up with new products or services, or come up with new ways of doing things.

There are two ways to overcome this obstacle: 1) Find a market for your idea and 2) Make sure your idea is something that the market wants.
