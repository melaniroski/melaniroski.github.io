Customer Loyalty: What is customer loyalty and how can it be increased in your business?

Loyalty is increased when businesses provide value, implement change, and are responsive to customer needs. Here are three new ideas for increasing customer loyalty in your business:
1. Offer more value to customers: When you offer more value to customers, they will become more loyal.
