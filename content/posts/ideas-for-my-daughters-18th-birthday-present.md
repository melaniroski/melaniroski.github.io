What is big ideas?
There are many different types of big ideas, but the three most common are the big picture, thinking outside the box, and creating a vision. Here are four tips on how to come up with big ideas:
1. Do your research: A good way to come up with big ideas is to do your research before you start thinking about them. Talk to people who have had experience in the field you’re interested in and see what they’ve done. What do they think is important? What can you learn from them? This will help you determine what is important to you and how you can focus on it while still leaving room for other ideas.

2. Be willing to try new things: You need to be willing to try new things if you want to come up with big ideas.

The risks and benefits of implementing big ideas.
Big ideas are important for businesses and individuals because they can help make large changes in how we live, work, and spend our time. However, implementation of big ideas can be risky and difficult. Here are four key dangers to avoid:
1. Losing sight of the goal: When a business or individual begins to focus on implementing a big idea, they may forget the main reason they created the idea in the first place- to make a difference in people’s lives. Once theirmain objective has been achieved (and often not easily), they may start thinking about other things instead of delivering on their original promise.

2. Failing to deliver on expectations: Big ideas often involve significant changes that could have a significant impact on both people and businesses if not executed flawlessly.
