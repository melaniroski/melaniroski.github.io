Introduce the topic of inventions.
Inventions are ideas or objects that are created with the purpose of solving a problem or making life easier. Inventors are people who come up with these ideas and create them.
Some inventions are world-changing, like the telephone or the airplane. Others solve more everyday problems, like a better mousetrap or a self-tying shoelace. No matter how big or small, all inventions start with an idea.

If you have an invention idea, the first step is to figure out if it’s something that people actually need or want. Once you’ve done that, it’s time to start working on making your invention a reality.

Overcoming obstacles: Discuss the challenges that inventors face and how they overcome them.
Invention is the process of coming up with an idea and turning it into a reality. It is a process that takes time, effort, and determination. Inventors often face many obstacles along the way, but they overcome them by being persistent and finding creative solutions.
One of the biggest challenges that inventors face is funding. Turning an idea into a reality can be expensive, and many inventors don’t have the money to do it on their own. They may need to find investors or take out loans to finance their invention.

Another obstacle that inventors face is making sure their invention is unique. There are already so many products on the market, and it can be difficult to stand out from the crowd. Inventors need to do their research and make sure their product is filling a need that isn’t being met by existing products.

Creative ideas: What should you include?
Creative ideas are a vital part of any business—not just creative businesses, but any business. Effective creative thinking can help businesses achieve their goals and improve their products or services. Here are some ideas to get you started:
1. Start with a mission: What is your company’s main purpose? What does it want to achieve? This will help you to define your creativity and make sure that all your ideas are focused on this one goal.

2. Define your target market: Once you have a mission, it’s time to define who your target market is. Who do you want to sell your products or services to? Do you want to attract people who already own certain types of products or services? Or are you targeting new customers who haven’t heard of your product or service yet?
