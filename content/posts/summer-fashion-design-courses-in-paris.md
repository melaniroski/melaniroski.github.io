Types of creativity: What is the difference between creative and non-creative art?
Creative art is a type of art that involves personal Vince Vaughn moments and doesn't stem from classical sources.

This type of creativity can be seen in everything from graffiti to photography. There are many different types of creative art, but the most common ones include mural painting, sculpture, music composition, and fine arts.

The benefits of big ideas: What are they, and why should we care?
Big ideas are the lifeblood of innovation. They can change the world, and sometimes all it takes is a great idea to get started. Here are three reasons why big ideas should be of utmost importance to businesses and individual citizens alike: 
1) Big ideas can inspire new thinking and creativity. When a business or individual sees something that they believe could have a profound impact, they often come up with new business models or theories to pursue those ideas. 

2) Big ideas can build communities of support. No one invention or discovery is ever complete; rather, every step in the development of big ideas brings us closer to becoming one cohesive unit. This sense of community also makes it easier for individuals to raise money and create products/services that have a real impact on society as a whole. 

3) Big ideas may help solve pressing global problems.

Creative minds can also come up with new ways of doing things when they are tired of the same old things.
