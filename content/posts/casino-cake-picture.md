Inspiration from Others: What sources can you draw from?
If you're looking to up your creative game, take inspiration from others. Whether it's learning new techniques or paying homage to classic pieces, there are endless possibilities out there. Here are a few ideas to get you started: 
Start with old pieces of art. Draw inspiration from both the beauty and functionality of older pieces. Use them as models for your own designs. 

Create a mashup. What if your favorite song was turned into a visual masterpiece? What if each image in your collection was mashed together into one cohesive work? This is what getting on the beaten path is all about – finding orphaned works of art and turning them into something special. 

Inspire yourself with nature. Take a walk in nature and see how different elements impact how you see things.

The benefits of creativity: How can it be used?
Creativity is a valuable tool that can be used to solve problems and create new ideas. There are many benefits to creativity, including making new friends, developing new skills, and increasing your productivity. Here are three ways creativity can be used in your life: 
1. Create original ideas: When you have an idea for a product or project, start by thinking about how you could make it better or more unique. Try to come up with a solution that nobody else has thought of before. This can be really helpful in getting started on a project or finding a solution to a problem.

2. Make connections: When you make new friends, it can be really helpful to get out and talk about your interests. It can also be fun to meet others who share the same interests as you do. This will help you develop relationships that are beneficial both professionally and personally.
