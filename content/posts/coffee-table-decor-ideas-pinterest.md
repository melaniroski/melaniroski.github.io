Assuming you have an invention idea and want to market it, there are a few key things to keep in mind. First, it's important to do your research and understand both the industry and your potential customers. Who is your target market? What needs does your product address?

Another option is to work with an invention marketing firm who can help you patent and protect your idea and then market it to potential buyers. Whichever route you choose, be sure to put together a strong pitch that highlights the need for your product and how it benefits consumers.
