Definition of big ideas: What are some examples?
Big ideas are ideas that have the potential to change the world. They are often large and ambitious, but they can be implemented easily and quickly. Here are some examples of big ideas:
1. A universal basic income: This idea would give everyone a fixed amount of money every month without any strings attached. It would help to lift people out of poverty and into a higher paying job.

2. A gender-neutral pronoun: This could be a huge political and social shift, as it would redefine what it means to be human. Additionally, it would help to break down many gender-based stereotypes.

3. A digital divide: This is a term that refers to the fact that many people in developed countries have more access to technology than those in developing countries. The digital divide has contributed to many social problems, such as inequality and poverty.

Types of creativity: Mental, physical, emotional, spiritual.
Creativity is an intangible quality that can be described in many ways. Mental creativity, for example, refers to the ability to come up with new ideas or solutions quickly and without thought. Physical creativity, on the other hand, refers to the ability to move your body and make physical changes in order to create new ideas or solutions. Emotional creativity, on the other hand, refers to the ability to feel positive emotions such as happiness, joy, joyfulness, and contentment. Spiritual creativity refers to the ability to connect with God or another higher power and come up with new ideas or solutions.

Tips for Working creatively: What to keep in mind?
Creative ideas can come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have one common goal: to make something new and beautiful. Here are a few tips to help you keep your creative juices flowing:
1. Be open to new ideas – anything that makes you think outside the box can be a good idea for a project.

2. Don’t hesitate to take risks – if something seems too risky, let it be. The important thing is that you don’t give up on your project until it’s finished, or until you find a better way to do it.

3. Take time to relax – working constantly will only lead to stress and fatigue. Instead, take some time for yourself each day, and work on tasks that are more calming and relaxing. This will help you stay focused and motivated throughout the process.

I’ve been fascinated by the brain for as long as I could remember. I love learning about it and its workings, and have spent countless hours reading and watching brain science documentaries. Now that I’m a doctor, I understand just how important brainstroming is to the health of patients and their families.
