How to come up with great ideas?
Ideas can be everything from creative to helpful, and they come in all shapes and sizes. To come up with great ideas, it's important to think outside the box. Here are four tips to help you get started:
1. Try different methods: When you have a good idea, don't just sit down and write it down. You might want to try thinking about it from a different perspective or using different language.

2. Get feedback: Take some time to get feedback from people who know what you're trying to do. They might have some great ideas of their own that you can use as a starting point.

3. Be open to change: If your idea is great, but it's not working for someone else, don't be afraid to make changes.
