Development and commercialization: How do you make money from your invention?
Invention ideas are all around us. Whether it's a new product or an idea for a new company, something can be invented and made into a business. There are many ways to monetize an invention, but there is one way that is always popular and payout: profit sharing. Profit sharing is when an inventor gets a percentage of the sales generated from their invention. It can be a great way to make some extra money while your invention remains in the public domain. There are different types of profit sharing, but one of the most common is share-the- wealth, which means that inventors receive a cut of any profits made by their invention. There are also royalty shares, which give inventors a share of the royalties received from selling their invention.

The inventor's journey: From the inspiration to the innovation.
Invention is a process of creating something new, whether it's a product or a service. It can be an idea that someone has for years, or something that they just come up with on the spot. When someone comes up with an invention, there are several steps that they go through in order to make it into a reality. The inventor needs to come up with a concept, create a prototype, and test the product or service before they release it to the public. There are also various other steps that need to be taken in order to bring an invention to market, such as marketing and protection. With such a long journey ahead of them, there are many innovators out there who are working hard in order to make their ideas into reality.
