Time: A DIY project will take longer than hiring a professional, so be sure you have the time to commit.

Cost: The initial cost of a DIY project may be cheaper, but if you make mistakes, it can end up costing more in the long run.

Skill Level: Not all projects are created equal. Some are much easier than others. Be honest with yourself about your skill level and whether or not you can handle the project.

Tools and Materials: You’ll need more than just a few tools and materials for most projects. Make sure you have everything you need before starting.
