The power of big ideas
There are certain ideas that have the power to change the world. These are the big ideas. And while some people may think that only governments and large organizations have the ability to enact change on a global scale, history has shown us time and again that it is often the power of an individual with a big idea that can make the biggest difference.
One person with a big idea can start a movement that changes the way we think about an issue or problem. We’ve seen it happen with civil rights, women’s rights, and environmental issues. It is one person who has the courage to stand up and say “this is wrong” or “this needs to change” who can start a chain reaction that leads to real and lasting change.

How do we become involved in the invention process?
Invention is a process where people come up with new ideas for products or services. It can be difficult to come up with new ideas, but there are many ways to get involved in the process. There are several ways to become involved in the invention process, and each has its own advantages and disadvantages.
One way to become involved in the invention process is to attend an inventor's mixer. An inventor's mixer allows people to share their ideas with other inventors and potential customers. It can also help people develop their ideas more effectively.

Another way to become involved in the invention process is by working on a project with another person. When you are working with someone else, you have a better chance of developing your idea together and making it a reality. This is important because it can help you learn about other people's concepts and how they would approach solving a problem.
