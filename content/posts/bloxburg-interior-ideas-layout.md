What are creative ideas?
Creative ideas are a great way to get your creative juices flowing and come up with new solutions to problems. There are many different creative ideas out there, so you need to find the ones that fit your needs and interests. Here are some ideas to get started: 
-Create a petition: This is a great way to get people’s attention and show them how you feel about something. You can start by creating a simple Petition on change.org or any other website. Once you have made your case, offer anyone who will listen an argument for why they should change the policy. 

-Dare yourself: If you don’t know what you want or aren’t sure how to get started, take some risks and try something new. Take on an assignment or complete a project that isn’t immediately related to your current lifestyle.

Business models: How to make an invention successful?
Invention ideas are a dime a dozen, but the ones that work can be very profitable. Here are four tips on how to make your invention successful:
1. Choose the right business model: Any invention should have a specific business model in mind before you can begin developing it. Make sure that your business is able to pay off its investment, generate income, and attract customers.

2. Get market saturation: Once your invention has reached a certain level of popularity, it will be more difficult to switch it to another business model. To get market saturation, make sure that your product or service is well-received by a wide range of people. This can include both potential customers and competitors.
