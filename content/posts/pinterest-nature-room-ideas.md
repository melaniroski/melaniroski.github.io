Eco-Friendly Home Improvements: How can you make your home more eco-friendly?
Eco-friendly home improvements are easy to make if you take the time to think about what you need and want. Here are a few ideas to help make your home more eco-friendly:
1. Make sure your heating and cooling system is eco-friendly. Not only will this save you money in the long run, but it can also help improve your environment by reducing emissions from your home.

2. Use recycled materials in your construction. When building or repairing your home, be sure to use recycled materials whenever possible. This not only saves you money in the long run, but it also helps reduce environmental impact on both of our planet’s inhabitants and future generations.

3. Use rainwater tanks rather than water systems that use water fluoridation products.

Brainstorming: How do you gather inspiration for your work?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but there are a few key things to keep in mind when brainstorming what to work on next. First, think about your audience: who are you trying to reach? Are you trying to inspire people to do something or just get some new ideas off your mind? Next, think about the problem you’re trying to solve: is it something that’s currently happening in the world or something that you can see happening in the future? Once you have an idea for a problem, it’s time to start coming up with ways to solve it. Finally, think about how you might approach solving the problem. Do you have any specific examples of how this has worked out before? If not, what kind of inspiration do you need?
