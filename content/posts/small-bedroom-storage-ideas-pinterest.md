Brainstorming: How do you gather inspiration for your work?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but there are a few key things to keep in mind when brainstorming what to work on next. First, think about your audience: who are you trying to reach? Are you trying to inspire people to do something or just get some new ideas off your mind? Next, think about the problem you’re trying to solve: is it something that’s currently happening in the world or something that you can see happening in the future? Once you have an idea for a problem, it’s time to start coming up with ways to solve it. Finally, think about how you might approach solving the problem. Do you have any specific examples of how this has worked out before? If not, what kind of inspiration do you need?

creating a plan: What are some steps you need to take in order to create a successful idea?
Creative ideas can be a huge asset to any business. However, they can also be extremely difficult to come by. In order to create a successful idea, you need to take some key steps. Here are some tips: 1. Brainstorming- It’s important to have an idea for something before starting the brainstorming process. This will help you come up with a great plan and ideas for what to pursue. 2. Diversification- If your idea is focused only on one market or industry, it will likely not be successful. You need to have at least two different ideas in mind before starting the development process. 3. Innovation- Another key factor in creating a successful idea is innovation.
