Definition of innovation: How does it differ from other concepts?
Innovation is the process of creating something new and different from what has been done before. It can be defined in many ways, but one common definition is that innovation is the creation of a new product, service, or idea that is better than what was available before. Innovation can be found in everything from fashion to technology to business.
If you think about it, innovation is pretty much just a way to make things better. After all, if there was nothing new or different out there to work with, how would anyone ever come up with a new idea? In fact, innovation often comes from coming up with an idea that nobody else has thought of before. So while it may seem like a pretty big responsibility, it's actually quite easy to get started on when you have some basic ideas about what you're looking for.

Definition of art: What is it, what does it mean, and why is it important?
Creative art is any art that is created for the sake of creative expression, or to make a statement. It can be found in all forms and mediums, but is most often associated with visual arts. Keywords include: expression, meaning, and purpose. The definition of art has evolved over time to reflect these key concepts.
The origins of art go back to ancient times when people used symbols and images to communicate their ideas and emotions. The Egyptians were particularly skilled at this, as they had a very deep understanding of mythology and religious symbolism. Over time, however, the use of paint and other materials replaced writing as the main form of communication in many cultures. This change was due in part to technological advances, which made it possible to produce large numbers of pictures with greater realism than ever before.
