What are big ideas?
In recent weeks, we've heard a lot about big ideas. Ideas that could change the world, ideas that could make your company better, and ideas that could revolutionize how you do business. But what are big ideas? And how can they be used to improve your business? Here are some tips: 
-Think about the potential implications of your idea. What could it mean for customers, employees, or competitors? 
-Generate ways to test and measure the effectiveness of your idea. What would people say if they had access to this new product or service? How would you market and sell it? 
-Make sure you have a clear vision for your idea. What does your business need in order to achieve its goals? What does this new product or service offer that others don't? How will customers feel about using it?

Conclusion: the importance of creativity in our lives
When it comes to creativity, we often think of artistic pursuits like painting or writing.  However, creativity is so much more than that. It’s about thinking outside the box, coming up with new ideas and solutions, and looking at the world in a different way.
In our fast-paced, constantly changing world, creativity is more important than ever. We need to be able to adapt and come up with new ideas to solve problems. If we get stuck in the same way of thinking, we’ll never progress.

So next time you’re feeling stuck, don’t give up. Take a step back and look at the situation from a different perspective. You never know what creative solution you might come up with.

Ideas are the lifeblood of a democracy. They give people a vision for the future and help them to achieve it. Ideas can come from anyone, including the government, business, or individual citizens.

If you're looking to improve your home ventilation, there are a few things you can do to help. One is to consider adding natural light into your home. This can be done by installing window coverings that let in natural light, or by building a ventilation system that encourages the release of air and warm up the room with fans.
