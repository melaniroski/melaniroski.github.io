    Ideas can be anything and everything. They can be new ways of looking at an old problem, or new ways to approach an old one. They can be a way to think about something that you've never thought of before, or a way to come up with a solution to a problem that you've never even contemplated. Ideas are the lifeblood of creativity, and without them, we might just as well give up.

Outlook: What do you think the future of technology holds for our industry?
As the world becomes increasingly connected, technology is changing the way businesses operate. Some of the biggest changes include the rise of online shopping and the increasing use of mobile devices. As this change takes place, many companies are looking to adapt their strategies in order to survive. 
One company that has been adapting quickly is Microsoft. The Redmond-based company has long been a leader in software and hardware development, but it's now focusing its efforts on developing “big ideas” that could have a significant impact on business. 

Microsoft has been working on a number of projects that could have a major impact on the future of technology. One project is called Project Apollo, which is focused on developing a new type of computer memory known as Accelerated Persistent Memory (APM).

Idea 1: Share your life story
If you've been married for 10 years, or longer, you know that sharing your life story is a tradition. It's a way to show people that you're committed to them and appreciate them. But what if sharing your life story doesn't feel like it's important to you? What if it feels like a chore?
That's where ideas come in. In order to feel more fulfilled in our lives, we need to focus on what truly matters. So why not share your life story with someone who mattersthrough those experiences? Why not tell them everything about your marital status, your job history, and all of the little things that make up your day-to-day?

It'll give them a currency of understanding and appreciation. Plus, they might be inspired by how much you appreciate them themselves... which is always an added bonus!
