1. Get in the habit of thinking creatively. If you want to be more creative, you need to start by thinking creatively. This means looking at things from different perspectives and brainstorming new ideas.
2. Be open to new ideas. When you're open to new ideas, you're more likely to have them. So don't be afraid to try something new or think outside the box.

3. Be persistent. Creative thinking often requires trial and error. So don't give up if your first idea doesn't work out. Keep trying until you find something that works for you.
