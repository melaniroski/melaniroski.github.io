What are the big ideas behind your organization?
1. What is your organization's mission? What are its core values? How do you hold yourselves accountable to those values?
2. What makes your organization unique? How do you attract and keep talented individuals and teams?
3. Who decides what is important to your organization? How do you make sure that everyone knows and agrees with the organization's mission and goals?
4. How do you manage conflict within your organization? Who has final say on important decisions, and who can appeal if they feel their opinion is not being heard or respected?
5. Are there any Committee or Board members that are not elected by the membership, but rather appointed by someone outside of the organization (e.g., CEO)? If so, how does this affect the ability for members to voice their opinions effectively within the organization?

The role of innovation in business:
Innovation is a key component of business success. It allows businesses to change and improve their products, services and processes in order to meet customer needs. However, innovation can also be a challenge. Sometimes, businesses find it difficult to identify the best ideas for new products or services and implement them successfully. This can lead to disappointment and even failure.
One way to overcome this challenge is by taking advantage of innovative technologies. Technologies that allow businesses to quickly create new products or services are often more successful than those that require more thought or effort. For example, online tools that help businesses track customer data are often more popular than those that involve physical visits or surveys.

Banks, insurance companies and other large organizations have used online tools for years in order to keep track of their customers’ spending habits and investments.
