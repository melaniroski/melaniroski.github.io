What are some invention ideas?
There are many invention ideas out there, and it can be hard to know which ones to pursue. Here are a few tips to help you make the best choices:
1. Look at what others have done before you. If you're looking for an idea that's already been done, take a look at existing patents, copyrights, or other sources of inspiration.

2. Consider your target market. What is your target market? Are you looking for a specific audience or market? This will help you determine which invention ideas might be most successful for you.

3. Try multiple methods of experimentation. You don't have to duplicate everything that someone else has done before you; instead, try different methods of experimentation and see which ones work best for you.

4. Get feedback from people who know your target market well.
