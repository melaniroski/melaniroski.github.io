Conclusion: Invent something today
Invention Ideas: How to Be More Creative and Inventive
When it comes to being creative, there are a few things you can do to help yourself become more inventive. First, take some time to brainstorm. Get a piece of paper and a pen, and start jotting down whatever comes to mind. Don't censor yourself; just let the ideas flow. Once you have a good list of ideas, start looking for patterns and connections between them. What do they have in common? What are their differences?

Another helpful tip is to try something new. Be open to exploring different activities, hobbies, and interests. This will help broaden your perspective and give you more fodder for your brainstorming sessions. Finally, don't be afraid to experiment. The best way to come up with new ideas is to play around with the ones you already have.

brain washing: How can people be made to do things they don't want to do?
How can people be made to do things they don't want to do? There are many ways, but some of the most common methods are brainwashing and suggestion. Brainwashing is a process of inducing someone to change their views or behavior by using persuasive techniques. suggesting someone does something based on their eagerness or attraction often works better than actual coercion. Brainwashing techniques typically range from subtle (like reinforcing positive thoughts) to blatant (such as convincing someone that they have no choice in the matter). 
There are a few different types of brainwashing, but the most common is suggestion. Suggestion is when you say something that might make someone do something they wouldn't normally do. For example, if you tell a person they have to go outside for 5 minutes, that might suggest to them that it's time for them to get up and leave.
