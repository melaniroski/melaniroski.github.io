The creation process: How a person goes from inspiration to finished product
When someone starts creating art, they are likely inspired by something that has caught their eye. This might be a picture, a scene from a movie, or something they see in their everyday life. The process of becoming finished product is often like the journey of getting inspiration from somewhere else. The artist must first determine what they want to create and then go through the creative process of coming up with ideas and putting those ideas into a form that can be seen and touched.

The Challenge of Innovation: How do we stay ahead of the curve?
Innovation is a challenge for any organization, but it's especially hard to keep up with the curve when it comes to technology. Many times, innovation can come from scratch or from taking an existing product and changing its features or design. But whether it's something as simple as a new way of packaging food or a transformed business model, staying ahead of the curve can be tricky.
One way to overcome this challenge is to build on what others have done before. This can be done through collaboration and learning from others, as well as by listening carefully to what customers want and need. It's also important to focus on what customers want most, rather than just trying to please everyone.

There are several ways that an organization can stay ahead of the curve when it comes to innovation.
