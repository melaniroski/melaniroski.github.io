Conclusion: the importance of invention
Invention is the key to progress. It is the engine of change. It drives economies and creates new industries.
Invention is important because it leads to progress. Progress is defined as a forward or onward movement toward a destination. It is the opposite of regression, or a return to a previous state. In order for there to be progress, there must be invention. Invention leads to progress by creating new products, processes, or services that are more efficient than the existing ones.

Types of creativity: What are the types of creativity?
Creativity can be defined in many ways, but the most common definition is that creativity is the process of coming up with new ideas or visions. This definition could be used to describe almost any creative act, but art is an especially good example because it is often associated with creativity.
There are many types of creativity, but some of the most common are: visual, musical, and acoustic. Visual creativity includes thinking outside the box and coming up with original ideas or concepts. Musical creativity includes creating music that is unique and inspires emotions. Acoustic creativity includes creating sounds that are unique and inspire feelings or emotions. These three types of creativity are just a few examples; there are countless other creative acts that can be done without using these three specific terms.

If you think about it, Creativity seems like a pretty basic concept.
