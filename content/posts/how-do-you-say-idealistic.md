Conclusion
A good conclusion is the final ingredient in a creative work. It gives the audience a sense of closure and resolution, and can leave them feeling satisfied or even uplifted. A weak conclusion, on the other hand, can leave the audience feeling let down and dissatisfied.
To create a strong conclusion, start by thinking about what you want your audience to take away from your work. What are the main points you want to make? Once you know what you want to say, find a way to say it that is both memorable and impactful.

End with a bang, not a whimper. A powerful image, striking turn of phrase, or thought-provoking question can all make for a memorable conclusion. Whatever you do, don't simply repeat what came before or restate your thesis in a boring way.
