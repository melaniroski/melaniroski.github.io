The Power of Idea: How do we get the most out of our ideas?
Ideas are the lifeblood of any business and creativity. From businesses to creativity, ideas can be the key to success. Here are five tips on how to get the most out of your ideas:
1. Define what you want your idea to achieve. Without a clear goal, it will be much harder to motivate yourself to work on it. define your idea in broad terms and break it down into smaller steps that you can complete easily. This will help you stay focused on the task at hand and avoid getting lost in the weeds.

2. Take a step back and ask yourself why you think this concept or product is necessary or valuable. Once you have a good reason for your idea, it becomes easier to focus on developing it further and writing marketability plans accordingly.

The creative process: How does the creative process work?
Creative ideas come to life when artists and writers share their thoughts, feelings and experiences with one another. The creative process begins with inspiration, which is the first step in developing a creative idea. Next, the artist or writer must come up with a unique concept that will capture the attention of others. Once the idea has been captured, it’s time for the writer or artist to flesh out the idea into a full-blown story or novel. Finally, unless there’s an incredible lucky streak, every book or story has to be well-researched and Fallon writes about creating new ideas on a daily basis - whether that’s coming up with an original character or imagining what might happen if she were ever given the opportunity to work on a project her own choosing.
