Definition: Innovation: the process or product of making a new and better version of an existing thing.
Innovation is the process or product of making a new and better version of an existing thing. It can refer to various aspects of technology, business, and creativity. Innovation often occurs when a company or individual discovers a new way to do something that earlier versions were unable to do. Additionally, innovation can come from the invention of a new product or idea. However, it is also possible for innovation to come from the development of a technology that was never before used in the industry. In both cases, innovation is a key factor in creating value for customers and shareholders alike.

Development: How do you actually develop an invention idea?
When it comes to developing an invention idea, the best way is to do some research and figure out what you want to create. If you have a specific problem that you want to solve, then brainstorm a few possible solutions. However, if you don't know what you're looking for or if you just don't have any ideas, then brainstorming won't help. The best way to come up with an invention idea is by doing some tinkering and experimenting. Once you've had a few prototypes created, it's time to start turning them into a product. By doing this, you'll be able to see how people use your product and see where potential problems might exist.
