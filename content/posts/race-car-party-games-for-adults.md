Conclusion: Tips for beekeeping and business success with brainstroming
Are you looking to be a successful beekeeper? If so, there are some key things you can do to help. One important thing to keep in mind is that brainstroming is one of the most successful business strategies around. Here are five tips for becoming a more successful beekeeper:

1. Take your time with each hive
Bees aren't constantly on the move, so it takes time to get their colonies up and running. Don't try to rush things - take your time and make sure everything is checked and balanced before starting hives again. This will help ensure that the colony is healthy and thriving.
2. Know your colonies' needs
When you're setting up your hive, it's important to know what the colony's needs are. Knowing what food they need, water requirements, space needed, etc.

2020: How do we make sure that our 2020 election is fair?
In 2020, the United States will face another harsh election season. Key issues that will be debated include how to make sure that the election is fair and what measures can be taken to prevent fraud. Here are four ideas for making sure that the 2020 election is fair: 
1. Create a public database of all registered electors in order to help ensure accuracy and transparency. This would help reduce voter fraud and make it easier for voters to check whether their ballot has been cast correctly. 
2. Increase the number of voting machines from precincts to whole neighborhoods so that more people can vote in one voting place rather than scattered throughout various precincts. This would improve security and ensure that all ballots are counted accurately. 
3. Make it easier for citizens with disabilities to vote by offering identification requirements or waiving residency requirements in certain cases.

The Use of Invention: What are some examples?
Invention is the use of a creative idea, or a new method or process, to produce a product or service. Invention can come from anywhere: in your mind, in your backyard, on the internet, or even from someone you know. 
There are many examples of invention. For example, think about the wheel- an invention that changed the way we move around. There are also inventions that have had huge impacts on society and the world like the telephone, antibiotics, and jet engines- all of which were invented by people who were not just working on their own but were part of a team. 
Inventions can be really amazing or really terrible. But they always have a big impact because they help us do things that we couldn't do before and they make our lives easier.
